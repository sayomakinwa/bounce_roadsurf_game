# Bounce Roadsurf Game
This project work is a version of an Endless Roller Game that I have [adapted from this tutorial](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-simple-3d-endless-runner-game-using-three-js--cms-29157) and made it akin to Google Chrome's T-Rex game where you race it out for maximum possible points. I have called it “Endless Roadsurf Game”.
The game consists of a golden spherical ball that endlessly runs at a constant speed (determined by the difficulty level that the user is able to set) on an abandoned slopy road filled with grown trees and the debris of chopped down trees that make up the obstacles in the game. The goal of the player is to continuously avoid colliding with any of these obstacles for as long as possible. Points increase at a constant rate (also determined by the difficulty level) and the game ends when the ball runs into any of the obstacles on the path.

The game is played completely with the left, right, and up (or spacebar) arrow keys on the keyboard with no mouse interaction.
